<h2>The Artist</h2>
<p>Marshall mathers, aka Eminem, didnt just show up to rap—he came to flip the whole damn game. Dude came outta Detroit's underground scene spittin truth, pain, and wild-ass bars that made people stop and listen. his flow? sharp as hell. his lyrics? raw, real, and straight from the gut. Whether you love him or hate him, you can’t deny the man left a mark so deep in the game, it ain’t ever fading</p>

<h2>Breakthrough</h2>
<p>"Back in ‘99, Em dropped The Slim shady LP and the world met his wild-ass alter ego, Slim shady. That shit was dark, twisted, and funny as hell—like therapy with a beat. He scooped a Grammy and sold over 18 MILLION copies WORLDWIDE. The honesty, the chaos, the no-filter bars? That album wasnt just a debut—it was a god damn detonation</p>

<h2>Record Breaker</h2>
<p>"Then came The marshall mathers LP in 2000—and it smashed every damn record. Fastest selling solo album in U.S history at the time 1.76 mil in the first damn week. No sugarcoating, just a brutal deep dive into the messed up side of fame. That joint locked Em in as one of the realest to ever do it.</p>
